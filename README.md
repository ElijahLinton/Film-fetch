# Film-Fetch

## Description

- The motivation for this project is to create a movie library to find your favorite movies at the press of a button.
- We decided to build this site because we all share a common love for movies and each have different taste in film.
- This search engine pulls films by title so if the user cannot remember the full name of a film the site will find all similar titles.
- The webpage is easy for you to access through one link : https://elijahlinton.github.io/Film-fetch/ and is designed to work with different screen sizes as you need.

## User Story
